## Fibonacci's Button

The Fibonacci Sequence is an integer sequence commonly used in places where increasing sequences are needed, like login throttling or coding interview questions :smile:. Formally it's defined as:

```
fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```

For this exercise we'll use the following base cases:
```
fib(0) = 0
fib(1) = 1
```


### What do I do?

This is a simple test of basic CS fundamentals as well as basic Angular knowledge. The spec is as follows:

- [ ] A single page that contains two buttons, `Reset` and `Next Fib`, as well as the current value of the sequence interpolated above it, starting at 0.
- [ ] When the `Next Fib` button is clicked, we will update the view to display the next step of the sequence.
- [ ] Clicking the `Reset` button will reset the sequence to the base case
- The buttons and text should be styled similarly to the screenshot below:

### For consideration:

- Don't worry too much about dependency management. Including angular in a `<script>` tag is fine for this example.
- Performance is important here. Make sure to watch how frequently you're evaluating a `fib()` function such that you're only running it as needed.
- Update the last section of this `README.md` with any thoughts or explanations you may have.
- You can choose to use recursion or iteration for your implementation, but please let us know why you chose the one you did in the README.

### Extra Credit

- Two `Next Fib` buttons, one that uses an iterative Fibonacci algorithm, and another that uses a recursive one, labeled appropriately.
- Automated tests included for the project. Use your framework of choice for testing and include dependencies such that we can run the tests here.


### Solution Discussion:

- The `fastFib` function is memoized so it has less work to do.
- If building an actual app I would probably bundle assests with something like gulp, webpack, or fusebox
- If building an actual app I would also include a transpile step in the build process so I could use
the latest and greatest es6 and beyond features.
- I'm not too familiar with unit testing angular 1 apps. If I had more time I'd probably research options
in this area. Since angular 1 apps don't use node style imports I suspect testing requires some angular 1
specific tooling.
